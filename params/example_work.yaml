# ============================ CRX5IA Livox Mid-70 Configuration ============================
# Optimized for UPWARD-FACING LiDAR mounted on base_link
# LiDAR position: xyz="0.275 0.0 0.09" rpy="0 -Ï€/2 0" (facing up)
# Robot dimensions: l_base=0.185m, l_2=0.41m, l_4=0.43m, l_5=0.13m, l_6=0.145m
# IMPORTANT: Robot arm joints use mesh collision shapes with scale="0.001 0.001 0.001" in URDF
# SCALING: Use primitive collision shapes for reliable visualization and filtering
